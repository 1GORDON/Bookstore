# Bookstore

In this project, I achieved the following

- Initialised React app.
- Added React Redux (npm install react-redux).
- Structured your application files using a "feature folder" approach and use the ducks pattern for your Redux files.
- Added React Router and set two Routes and Links for the app's navigation:
- Books should display the list of books with the Remove button, should have a form for adding a book
- Categories should display "Under construction" text only.
